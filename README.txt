Applied convolutional neural networks on the breast cancer images.

What you need?
Basic understanding of deep learning frame: caffe(Now i have switched to theano...)

Multi-layer convolutional neural networks(think about it: logistic regression can be considered
as one layer neural networks)

Cluster computing resources with GPU(Important!)

Sorry about no data sets here, since each whole slide image is too big to store in memory. But you can 
refer to the caffe docs and write your own solver according to your problems.
